For all use cases, the main user can be the project manager and based on the group work, "Project Manager" would be more adequate. 
Dont forget to complete the "-ainda a definir como -" fields.

Use Case: Remove Filter/Label
On 'Description', theres an sintax error: "a existen" -> "an existing";
"For eacht..." -> "For each ..."
Post-conditions: "... label was removed ..."

Use Case: Assoceate Filter/Label to a task
On 'Description', "Associates a existing label ...";


Besides the things mentioned above, good work and keep it that way :)
